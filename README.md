## Overview

This project is a partial threat model for a smart home system consisting of a front end system that
has interactions with users, some type of authentication, and interactions with at least one back
end server.
<!-- TODO: update description when I've fleshed it out. -->

The model consists of a few specific elements:

- Level 0, 1, and 2 data flow diagrams
- Threats identified using STRIDE
- A threat tree for one specific threat to the system
- Risks associated with five threats calculated using DREAD and FAIR
<!-- TODO: update model elements when I've fleshed it out. -->
